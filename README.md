# RedEM_PreBuild
A pre-built RedM server using the RedEM:RP framework. This is a basic server build, with only public resources. 
This is not a plug and play server download. You still will have to take a few steps in getting it set up to your preferences. 

You will need server artifacts. Head to the link below and download the latest recommended build.
https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/

- Download the files from the RedEM_PreBuild Github
- Un-Zip the RedEM_PreBuild folder
- In your search bar, type "This PC" 
- Select the drive you want the server saved on (In the default preview we used the C: drive)
- Take the un-zipped RedEM_PreBuild file and drag it to the drive you want to use
- You should have already downloaded the latest recommended server build artifacts, if you have not, do so now. 
- Un-zip the server artifacts folder and drag the server folder and drop it in your RedEM_PreBuild folder. 
- RedEM_PreBuild folder should now have TWO(2) folders inside it, the original server-data folder that came with the download
  and the server folder that you just added.
- You will need cfx-server-data, go here and download it https://github.com/Wollffus/cfx-server-data
- Un-zip the cfx-server-data folder
- open RedEM_PreBuild > server-data > resources
- Drag [gamemodes], [gameplay], [local], [managers], [system], and [test] from the cfx-server-data folder and add them to RedEM_PreBuild > server-data > resources

You will also need a database set up, here is a common user friendly one.
